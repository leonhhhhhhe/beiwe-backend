# We use the environment-variable-like configuration for RabbitMQ.
# documentation for all the environment variable options can be found at
# https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/configure#supported-environment-variables

# these extra comments are from an ancient version of the default rabbitmq.conf file.

# Defaults to rabbit. This can be useful if you want to run more than one node per machine -
# RABBITMQ_NODENAME should be unique per erlang-node-and-machine combination. See the clustering on
# a single machine guide for details:
# http://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html#single-machine
#NODENAME=rabbit

# By default RabbitMQ will bind to all interfaces, on IPv4 and IPv6 if available. Set this if you
# only want to bind to one network interface or# address family.
#NODE_IP_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1

# Defaults to 5672; we use port 50000.
NODE_PORT=50000

# 50001 is used by supervisord, so we will use 50002.
# Task distribution works without needing to modify the security groups, not 100% clear
# what this port is used for - its the erlang distribution port.
# if not present you get a "invalid_dist_port_range,70000" error because by default it takes the
# node port and adds 20k.  Sure.  Whatever.
RABBITMQ_DIST_PORT=50002
